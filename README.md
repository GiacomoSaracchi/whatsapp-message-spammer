# whatsapp-message-spammer
A single file containing the MessageSpammer class used to send or spam different kinds of text on Whatsapp Web

The code uses Selenium to access and navigate Whatsapp.
It will need authentication (through scanning a QR code with your phone) upon accessing the web page as Whatsapp isn't necessarily compliant with automation.
The class enables you to send texts efforlessly, while voice messages and other forms of messages are a little tricker and currently undergoing improvements.
